## Installation & updates

Jangan lupa mengimpor file finaluas.sql

1. Pull
2. ketik composer update di terminal

3. copy file env menjadi .env, lalu ubah konfigurasi seperti baseURL (baseURL letaknya di folder public agar dapat mengambil assets), database default configuration

4. Start apache + mysql

5. id admin = admin

6. pw = codeigniter

When updating, check the release notes to see if there are any changes you might need to apply
to your `app` folder. The affected files can be copied or merged from
`vendor/codeigniter4/framework/app`.

## Setup

Copy `env` to `.env` and tailor for your app, specifically the baseURL
and any database settings.

## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the _public_ folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's _public_ folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter _public/..._, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!
The user guide updating and deployment is a bit awkward at the moment, but we are working on it!

## Repository Management

We use Github issues, in our main repository, to track **BUGS** and to track approved **DEVELOPMENT** work packages.
We use our [forum](http://forum.codeigniter.com) to provide SUPPORT and to discuss
FEATURE REQUESTS.

This repository is a "distribution" one, built by our release preparation script.
Problems with it can be raised on our forum, or as issues in the main repository.
